NAME
       tiemu - a TI's hand-helds emulator (m68k-based)

SYNOPSYS
       tiemu [-h] [-v] [--help] [--version] [--import] [-rom=] [-tib=] [-sav=]
       [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       The TiEmu program allows you to emulate a Texas Instruments  calculator
       such  as TI89, TI89 Titanium, TI92, TI92+ or V200PLT.  The emulator has
       also a virtual link capability which allows to connect  it  to  another
       program (such as TiLP for instance).

OPTIONS
       The command line options override the default options (startup options)
       and the config file options even.  The TiEmu program accepts  the  fol-
       lowing options:

       -h, --help
              Display a list of all command line options.

       -v, --version
              Output the version info.

       --import=
              Import ROM or TIB into repository and exit. Can be used for cre-
              ating images (as an example).  This flag must be set before -rom
              or -tib !

       -rom=  Convert and use the specified dump as image. Note that the image
              is added to the image repository.  Provided for compatibility.

       -tib=  Convert and use the specified tib/upgrade as image. Idem.   Pro-
              vided for compatibility.

       -sav=  Load  the  specified state file. Must be a valid state image and
              target for emulated calculator.  Provided for compatibility.

       filename
              Load a ROM/TIB/SAV file. ROM & TIB files are converted and added
              to  images  repository. Image corresponding to SAV file is auto-
              matically loaded and state is load.


CONFIG FILE FORMAT
       This section describes the format of the .tiemu config file which is in
       the  home  directory of the user (Linux) or in the Program Files folder
       (Win32). A line preceded by the '#' symbol is a comment.  Each line has
       the  following  format:  key=value.   The  config  file  must  have the
       'RC_END' string at end.  Every line can be put in any order.   Take  in
       mind  that  any  comment  added in the config file will be overwritten.
       Below is described each option and the possible values:

       calctype= Defines the calculator type for link parameter. Valid  values
       are:  ti89,  ti89t,  ti92, ti92+, v200.  Note: don't need to touch this
       setting, it's overridden by TiEmu. Kept for compatibility.

       linktype= Define the link cable  type.  Choose  one  of  the  following
       value:  none,  parallel, serial, TIGraphLink, virtual, TiEmulator, VTi,
       UsbGraphLink.

       port= Define a link port to use. Can  be:  null,  user,  parallel  port
       #1|2|3, serial port #1|2|3|4, virtual port #1|2, USB port #1.

       method=  Define  an  I/O method to use. Possible values are: automatic,
       asm, api, driver, null.

       adr_port= places the I/O address of the I/O port  to  use.  It  can  be
       0x3F8 for a serial port or 0x378 for a parallel port for instance.

       serial_device=  places  the character device name of the serial port to
       use with a Grey TIGL.

       timeout= with the timeout value to use in  tenth  of  seconds.  Default
       value: 20.

       delay=  with  the  delay  value  to  use in micro-seconds for home-made
       cables. Default value: 10

       background= Define whether TiEmu display the whole frame (keyboard+LCD)
       or  just  the  LCD  screen. Set to 0 if you do not want to use the key-
       board.

       skin_file= Define the custom skin file to use.  Must  be  a  full  path
       name.

       keys_file= Define the keymap to use. Must be a full path name.

       img_file=  Define  the  TiEmu  image to load at startup. Must be a full
       path name.

       tib_file= Define the FLASH upgrade (tib or .9xu/.89u) to load after the
       image. Must be a full path name.

       sav_file= Define the calculator state image to load at startup.

       cpu_rate=  Give  the  number of instructions executed by the M68000 per
       30ms timeslice. Default value is -1 (50000 insts/30ms).

       hw_rate= Give the OS2/OSC3 oscillator rate. Default value is -1 (427 on
       hw1 and 732 on hw2; OSC2 is incremented every 6250 OSC1 cycles).

       lcd_rate=  Define  the  frame  rate of LCD refresh. Default value is -1
       (25ms => 40fps). Don't use a value smaller than 10ms.

       img_format= Defines the image format of the screenshots.  Several  for-

       LCD (lcd) or the entire window (skin).

       screen_file= Defines the base filename where  the  screenshot  will  be
       stored.

       screen_counter= This allows you to save the current screenshot counter.
       In   fact,   the   resulting   filename   is   computed   as   'screen-

       screen_skips= Number of frame to skip between 2 captures.

       console=  Available  under  Windows platform only. You can hide (no) or
       show (yes) the DOS console at startup or even display  it  only  during
       boot (boot).

       nothing (no).

       fs_type= TiEmu supports several file selectors for better  integration.
       The following options are supported:
       - native: native one (default): Win32 on Windows, KDE if built with KDE
       support and running under KDE, GTK+ 2.x else,
       - old: GTK 1.2 file selector,
       - new: GTK 2.x file selector (advanced capabilities and can show hidden
       files),
       - win32: deprecated (same as native),
       -  kde:  KDE  file  selector (only available if TiEmu is built with KDE
       support).

       bkpts_wnd=
       code_wnd=
       mem_wnd=
       regs_wnd=
       pclog_wnd=
       stack_wnd=
       heap_wnd= Set geometry hints for the different windows of the debugger.
       The  format  is  (x,y,w,h,m,v)  where  x&y are coordinates, w&h are the
       size, m is set if window is minimized and v is set  if  the  window  is
       open.
       dbg_font_type=  Enable custom font if set to "custom"; use default font
       if set to "default".
       dbg_font_name= Name of font to use. It must be a valid  Pango  descrip-
       tion  font  name:  a  string  representation in the form "[FAMILY-LIST]
       [STYLE-OPTIONS] [SIZE]", where FAMILY-LIST is a comma separated list of
       families  optionally  terminated by a comma, STYLE_OPTIONS is a whites-
       pace separated list of words where each WORD describes  one  of  style,
       variant,  weight,  or  stretch,  and SIZE is an decimal number (size in
       points). Any one of the  options  may  be  absent.  If  FAMILY-LIST  is
       absent,  then  the  family_name field of the resulting font description
       will be initialized to NULL. If  STYLE-OPTIONS  is  missing,  then  all
       style  options  will  be set to the default values. If SIZE is missing,
       the size in the resulting font description will be set to 0.


       Think to terminate your config script with the 'RC_END' word !!!
