Description: Texas Instruments calculators emulator (without GDB)
 TiEmu emulates Texas Instruments calculators TI-89/92/92+/V200PLT.
 .
 It is based on XTiger, the original TI emulator for Linux, which
 uses the 68k emulation core from UAE (The Ultimate Amiga Emulator).
 .
 You need to either dump the ROM of your calculator (you can do so
 with TiLP), or get a FLASH upgrade from Texas Instrument (see the software
 section concerning your calculator, then download the archive and
 extract the file) to use this emulator. There are *no* TI ROMs provided
 in this package, as they are copyrighted by Texas Instruments, Inc.
 .
 However, a free (as in speech) ROM is now provided with TiEmu, namely
 PedRom. Try it out!
 .
 This version includes a VTI-style assembly debugger.
 .
 Please note it exists another version (tiemu-gdb) not provided on Debian
 itself which includes a GDB-style assembly debugger for use with TIGCC
 and/or KTIGCC.
