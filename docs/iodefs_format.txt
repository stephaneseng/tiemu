This document describes the file format of iodefs_*_hw?.txt files.
Those files contains dynamic definitions of the various I/O ports
existing on calculators.

Filename is following this scheme: iodefs_[model]_hw[revision].txt.

1) This file is made up of various sections like [System]. 
Sections name are placed within brackets. 
Sections are interpreted as a top node.

2) Within each section, there are items like the following one:

$600001	| 1	| rw	| <.....2.0>			| Stack overflow	| AI7 enable,Interleave RAM

- first column is address
- second one tells how many bytes (1,2,4) are occuppied
- third one is access (ro,wo,rw)
- fourth one describes used bits; <all> is a convenient way to describe all bits
- fifth column is the name of the item (displayed at left)
- last column is a comma separated list of bit names. Don't write more than 16 chars for bit names

Keep in mind that there are very few syntactical checks: write the files with care!
