INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The TI-92 is capable of dynamically allocating memory blocks. There are
routines built into its ROM for this. It keeps track of allocated memory by
assigning a "handle" to each individual block of allocated memory. A handle
is a convenient way of keeping track of a single memory block. Even if the
block moves around, the handle does not change. Handles are, in a way,
"pointers to pointers".

On the TI-92, a handle is a word-sized integer. Each handle has a
corresponding pointer which points to the memory block represented by the
handle. This pointer is subject to change when other memory blocks are
deleted or resized. These pointers are kept in a table; this table is
pointed to by [$5D42], which usually points to $78B4.

To find the address of a handle's memory block, use the following formula.
Brackets [] are used to designate pointer indirection.

  address = [[$5D42] + handle * 4].L - 2

If this address evaluates to zero, the handle is unallocated. If it is
nonzero, it points to the beginning of the memory block. The first word
in the block, [address], contains the size of the block in words.

Memory blocks are kept in a linked list, starting from handle $0000. From
there, the handles may be in any order. The next block in the linked list
may be found with the following formula:

  next_address = address + [address].W * 2

The linked list is terminated when [next_address] equals zero.

STATIC MEMORY HANDLES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Handles 0000 through 0014 are system handles; each one is reserved for a
specific kind of data. These handles are always present, and are never
deleted. All handles from 0015 inclusive can contain any kind of dynamic
data, such as variables, folders other than "main", history entries, and
the custom menu.

NOTE: I'd advise against using these handles directly. They are probably
      subject to change in future ROM versions, and are arbitrarily in the
      order that they are in only because the ROM allocates them in that
      order during bootup. Anyway, they are all pointed to by various RAM
      globals, some of which may be documented in RAM-1_x.txt and/or
      ROM-2_1.txt.
